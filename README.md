# Challenge_13_-Alphabet_Soup_Applicant_Predictor
The objective of this challenge was to build a deep neural network model that can predict whether applicants requesting funding from a venture capital firm (Alphabet Soup) will be successful if funded.

## Technologies
The programming language used for this analysis was **Python (v 3.9.7)**.

The applicable libraries needed to run this analysis are:

` 1. Path from pathlib 2. pandas 3. numpy 4. sklearn.metrics 5. imblean.metrics 6. sklearn.model_selection 7. sklearn.linear_model 8. tensorflow 9. sklearn.preprocessing 10. tensorflow.keras.model 11. tensorflow.keras.layers  `

## Installation Guide
Majority of the above libraries should be part of the base applications that were installed with the Python version above; if not, you will have to install them through the pip package manager of Python.
